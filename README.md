# Data Science Enthusiast

### Education
B.Sc. Engineering Hons. in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa.

Sri Dharmaloka Collage, Kelaniya (Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry)

### Work Experience
Cybersecurity Engineer
-I have researched vulnerability assessment tools and conducted awareness sessions on how to use these tools effectively, including discussions on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies. Additionally, I performed testing using dummy VMs to simulate attack scenarios.

-I have also worked on branch firewall upgrades, implementing best practices, and gaining a deeper understanding of the larger network structure. During a Zscaler deployment project, I was involved in adding users, creating policies, troubleshooting user access issues, and analyzing data and user traffic for investigative purposes.

AI Research Engineer
- Finetuning LLAMA and GPT models. analyse the performence. Implement RLHF finetuning. implement RAG system with LLAMA and GPT. implement Time Series forcasting model.

### Projects
- Final Year research project 
 - Developed an image encoder model designed to extract flow, depth, and content features from monocular videos. The model was trained on an outdoor dataset and later tested on an indoor dataset. Despite the shift in domain, the model demonstrated excellent performance, highlighting its strong generalizability. Moreover, it outperformed the baseline metrics established in the research papers we referenced.
